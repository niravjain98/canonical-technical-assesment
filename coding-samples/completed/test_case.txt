Scenario: Testing a WiFi device (including encryption and WiFi protocols)

Test Case 1: Checking WiFi device availability and operability

Test Scenario: Verify that the WiFi device is recognized by the OS and is functioning properly.

- Setup: The WiFi device should be installed properly in the system and the system should be operational.

- Tools: Operating Systemâ€™s in-built network device listing features, WiFi scanning tools (for example, "iwlist" in Linux).

- Test Steps:
    1. List the network devices recognized by the operating system.
    2. Confirm that the WiFi device appears in the list.
    3. Use the WiFi scanning tool to list available networks.
    4. Confirm that the WiFi device can detect at least one network.

- Pass/Fail Criteria:
    1. If the WiFi device is listed in the network devices list, pass the first test.
    2. If the WiFi scanning tool can detect at least one network, pass the second test.

- Teardown: No special teardown required for this test.

Test Case 2: Testing WiFi device connection capabilities with encryption

Test Scenario: Verify that the WiFi device can connect to an encrypted network.

- Setup: An encrypted WiFi network should be set up and accessible. The SSID and password for the network should be known.

- Tools: Network management utilities (for example, "nmcli" in Linux).

- Test Steps:
    1. Use the network management utility to connect to the WiFi network.
    2. Confirm that the WiFi device is connected to the network.

- Pass/Fail Criteria:
    1. If the WiFi device can connect to the encrypted network, pass the test.

- Teardown: Disconnect from the WiFi network.

Test Case 3: Testing WiFi device compatibility with different WiFi protocols

Test Scenario: Verify that the WiFi device supports different WiFi protocols (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax).

- Setup: Multiple WiFi networks should be set up, each supporting different WiFi protocols. 

- Tools: Network management utilities (for example, "nmcli" in Linux).

- Test Steps:
    1. Use the network management utility to connect to each of the WiFi networks.
    2. Confirm that the WiFi device can connect to the network.

- Pass/Fail Criteria:
    1. If the WiFi device can connect to the network using a particular protocol, pass the test for that protocol.

- Teardown: Disconnect from the WiFi network.
